## Installation


``` r
remotes::install_github("pegeler/modulR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(modulR)

# Initialize
z11 <- m_arithmetic(11)

# What is 13 in Z_11?
z11$identity(13)

# Multiplication table in Z_11
z11$tables$mul
```
